# HUMAN-ACTIVITY-RECOGNITION-USING-SMARTPHONES
A variety of real time sensing applications are becoming available , especially in the life logging , fitness domains. These applications use mobile sensors embedded in smartphones to recognise human activities in order to get a better understanding of human behaviour. HAR system is required to recognize six basic human activities such as walking,jogging,moving upstairs,downstairs,running,sleeping by training a supervised learning model and displaying activities result as per input received from our accelerometer sensor and CNN model.

HRA has wide application in medical resrarch and human survey system.Here we will design a robust activity recognition system based on smartphone.The system uses 3 dimensional smartphone accelerometer as the only sensor to collect data from which features will be generated in both time and frequency domain.

Consider the below figure where different axes that is x,y and z axes of accelerometer sensors in different directions are shown and these axes change their directions according to the rotation of phone. So if anyone having a smartphone performs some activities then direction of these 3-axes will change accordingly.Then by observing these different values of accelerometer axes we can predict different type of activities performed by that person.

MOTIVATION
A Human Recognition System has various approaches, such as vision-based and sensor-based, which further categorized into wearables, object-tagged, dense sensing, etc. Before moving further, there also exist some design issues in HAR systems, such as selection of different types of sensors, data collection related set of rules, recognition performance, how much energy is consumed, processing capacity, and flexibility . Keeping all these parameters in mind, it is important to design an efficient and lightweight human activity recognition model. A network for mobile human activity recognition has been proposed using long-short term memory approach for human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers data.

BACKGROUND
The first HAR approach contains a large number of sensor type technologies that can be worn on-body known as wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and, together, both will make hybrid sensors that help in measuring quantities of human body motion. Various opportunities can be provided by these sensor technologies which can improve the robustness of the data through which human activities can be detected and also provide the services based on sensed information from real-time environments, such as cyber-physical-social systems there is also a type of magnetic senors when embedded in smartphone can track the positioning without any extra cost. 2. Vision-based—RGB video and depth cameras being used to obtain human actions. 3. Multimodal—Sensors data and visual data are being used to detect human activities
